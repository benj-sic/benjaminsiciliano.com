## üéØ **RECOMMENDED NEXT ADDITIONS**

### **Immediate Priority** (Next 3-5 metrics)

2. **Triadic Census** - Fundamental network pattern analysis
3. **Community Overlap** - Nodes in multiple communities
4. **Cascading Failure Analysis** - Advanced resilience testing
5. **Subgraph Centrality** - Alternative influence measure

### **Medium Priority** (Next 5-10 metrics)
1. **Communicability Centrality** - Information flow analysis
2. **Load Centrality** - Alternative betweenness measure
3. **Network Motifs** - Pattern recognition
4. **Clique Analysis** - Fully connected subgroups

## üìä **CURRENT ANALYSIS STATUS**

### **Files Generated**
- ‚úÖ `ANALYSIS_RESULTS.md` - Comprehensive results report
- ‚úÖ `biotech_network_metrics.csv` - All node and network metrics
- ‚úÖ 11 individual visualization files (SVG format)
- ‚úÖ All visualizations properly ordered (highest to lowest, top to bottom)
- ‚úÖ Top 10 filtering applied to relevant plots

### **Key Insights Discovered**
- **Emory University dominates** across all centrality measures
- **Network vulnerability** is high (0.906) - over-dependence on key nodes
- **100% core classification** - all organizations are well-connected
- **High structural holes** - good brokerage positions exist
- **Moderate community quality** - communities are reasonably well-defined

### **Potential Issues Identified**
- **Over-centralization** - too dependent on few key nodes
- **Single points of failure** - removing Emory could fragment network
- **Possible data bias** - Emory dominance might reflect data collection
- **Low algebraic connectivity** - network lacks structural robustness

## üîß **TECHNICAL NOTES**

### **Scripts Updated**
- `scripts/analyze_network.py` - Main analysis script with all metrics
- `scripts/create_visual_dashboard.py` - Dashboard generation (dashboards removed per request)

### **Visualization Standards**
- All plots ordered highest to lowest (top to bottom)
- Top 10 filtering applied to node breakdowns
- Consistent color schemes and formatting
- SVG format for scalability

### **Data Quality Considerations**
- Network shows signs of potential over-centralization
- Emory dominance across all metrics suggests possible bias
- High vulnerability indicates structural weaknesses
- Recommend data quality verification

## üìù **RESUMPTION INSTRUCTIONS**

To resume adding metrics:
1. Choose a metric from the "High Priority" or "Immediate Priority" lists
2. Add calculation method to `_calculate_[metric_name]()` in `analyze_network.py`
3. Add to `node_metrics` or `network_stats` as appropriate
4. Create visualization function `_plot_[metric_name]()` if needed
5. Update summary and results report sections
6. Run analysis and verify results
7. Update this TODO list with completion status
